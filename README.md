This is my duplicate repository of a 4 person group final project I was a part of for my software engineering class.

The screenshots I featured on my Readme are the parts I worked on most.

I developed/created the following:
- login screen and functionality
- Amazon AWS EC2 and RDS Instances
- create user page GUI
- announcement functionality
- homogenizing the styling of all pages for consistency
- ensuring rough adherance to bootstrap conventions
